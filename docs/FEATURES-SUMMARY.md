# Enhanced Gemini CLI - Key Features Summary

## 🤖 Autonomous Agent System

### What It Does

Executes complex, multi-step coding tasks independently with self-correction and
validation.

### Example Usage

```bash
# Give it a high-level task
$ gemini agent "Build a system to track my laptop logs and enhance productivity"

# The agent will:
1. ✅ Break down the task into steps
2. ✅ Create all necessary files (logger.py, database.py, etc.)
3. ✅ Run the code and check for errors
4. ✅ Fix errors automatically (e.g., install missing dependencies)
5. ✅ Test the code
6. ✅ Validate output matches your intent
7. ✅ Refine if needed
8. ✅ Deliver working solution

# Result: Complete working system in minutes
```

### Key Capabilities

- **Iterative Error Resolution**: Automatically debugs and fixes code errors
- **Self-Validation**: Compares output against your original intent
- **Learning**: Remembers successful patterns, avoids past mistakes
- **Multi-Step Execution**: Handles complex workflows from start to finish

## 💭 Cross-Session Contextual Memory

### What It Does

Remembers and references all previous conversations, providing continuity across
sessions.

### Example Usage

```bash
# Week 1: Discuss authentication
$ gemini "Let's implement JWT authentication"
[Implementation discussion...]

# Week 3: Add new feature (different session)
$ gemini "Add OAuth2 support"

# The CLI automatically says:
"📚 I remember our JWT implementation from Oct 15.
 I'll integrate OAuth2 alongside the existing JWT system..."

# It knows:
- What you built before
- How you built it
- Why certain decisions were made
```

### Key Capabilities

- **Semantic Search**: Find past conversations by meaning, not just keywords
- **Entity Tracking**: Remembers every file, database, API you discussed
- **Smart Context Injection**: Automatically includes relevant past context
- **Knowledge Graph**: Maps relationships between code concepts
- **File History**: Shows all conversations about specific files

### Commands

```bash
# Find conversations about specific code
$ gemini context --entity "user-service.ts"

# View file discussion history
$ gemini history --file "database/schema.sql"

# Semantic search across all sessions
$ gemini search "how did I implement rate limiting"
```

## 🔄 Multi-Provider LLM Support

### What It Does

Works with any LLM provider - Gemini, GPT-4, Claude, Ollama, OpenRouter, etc.

### Example Usage

```bash
# Use Ollama for local/private work
$ gemini config set provider ollama
$ gemini config set model llama3

# Use OpenRouter to access 100+ models
$ gemini config set provider openrouter
$ gemini config set model anthropic/claude-3-opus

# Let it auto-select best provider for each task
$ gemini config set routing.strategy "cost-optimized"
```

### Key Capabilities

- **Provider Flexibility**: Switch between providers anytime
- **Local Models**: Run completely offline with Ollama
- **Cost Optimization**: Route to cheapest provider per task
- **Automatic Fallback**: Switches providers if one fails
- **OpenRouter Integration**: Access 100+ models with one API key

---

## 🌳 Session Branching

### What It Does

Create alternative conversation paths and compare different approaches.

### Example Usage

```bash
# At any point, create alternative responses
$ gemini branch create "Try alternative approach"

# Compare different solutions
$ gemini branch compare branch-1 branch-2

# Switch between branches
$ gemini branch switch <branch-id>

# List all branches
$ gemini branch list
```

### Use Cases

- Try different implementation approaches
- Compare solutions from different LLMs
- Maintain multiple conversation threads
- Explore alternative architectures

---

## 🎯 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Complex Task Execution

```bash
$ gemini agent "Create a REST API for user authentication with JWT"

Agent Output:
✅ Step 1/8: Created src/models/User.ts
✅ Step 2/8: Created src/routes/auth.ts
✅ Step 3/8: Created src/middleware/authMiddleware.ts
❌ Step 4/8: Test failed - Missing bcrypt dependency
🔧 Installing bcrypt...
✅ Step 4/8: Tests passed
✅ Step 5/8: Created src/utils/jwt.ts
✅ Step 6/8: Added environment variables
✅ Step 7/8: Created documentation
✅ Step 8/8: Validation complete (Score: 92/100)

Files created:
- src/models/User.ts (85 lines)
- src/routes/auth.ts (120 lines)
- src/middleware/authMiddleware.ts (45 lines)
- src/utils/jwt.ts (60 lines)
- tests/auth.test.ts (95 lines)
- README.md (140 lines)

Task completed in 3 minutes 45 seconds
```

### Example 2: Context-Aware Development

```bash
# Week 1: Initial setup
$ gemini "Set up a PostgreSQL database for our app"
[Creates schema, migrations, setup scripts]

# Week 2: Different session, same context
$ gemini "Add a users table"

Agent: "📚 I remember we set up PostgreSQL on Oct 10 with
        migrations in db/migrations/. I'll add the users table
        following that pattern."

[Creates migration file in correct location with proper naming]

# Week 3: Bug fix
$ gemini "Users can't update their profiles"

Agent: "🔍 Checking our database history...
        Found: Users table created Oct 12
        Found: Profile update route added Oct 18

        Let me check the migration files and update logic..."

[Debugs with full context of system evolution]
```

### Example 3: Multi-Provider Workflow

```bash
# Use different providers for different tasks

# Fast iteration with Gemini Flash
$ gemini --model gemini-flash "Generate 10 test cases"

# Complex reasoning with GPT-4
$ gemini --provider openai --model gpt-4 "Design system architecture"

# Local/private work with Ollama
$ gemini --provider ollama --model llama3 "Review this code"

# Cost optimization
$ gemini config set routing.strategy "cost-optimized"
[Automatically uses cheapest model that meets quality requirements]
```
